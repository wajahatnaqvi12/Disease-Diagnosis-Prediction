# Disease Diagnosis Prediction

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes diagnoses using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset. The notebook includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation techniques.

## üß¨ Overview

The notebook walks through:
- Loading and exploring the PIMA Diabetes dataset
- Data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis
- Feature selection and model training
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics and ROC curves

## üîç Dataset

The [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository includes diagnostic measurements of female patients for diabetes prediction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
